recipe_nugget:: I used _**Challenge butter**_ in this Broccoli Cheese Casserole because it’s the BEST. Challenge is the brand of butter I’ve used and trusted for years and years. Made with 100% real cream, it’s my butter of choice. I’ve been using Challenge products my whole life and trust their products. I know the quality is outstanding and use it for all my baking and cooking!

## Instructions
- Preheat oven to 400°F and lightly grease a 9 x 13 baking dish, set aside.
    
- Cook broccoli by placing in a microwave bowl and covering. Microwave for 3½ to 4 minutes until broccoli is tender and bright green. Do not overcook. (Alternatively, bring a large pot of water to a boil, add broccoli and cook for 4 minutes until broccoli is bright green and tender. Remove with a slotted spoon and let drain thoroughly before adding to recipe.)
    
- In a large deep skillet or dutch oven, melt butter and olive oil together over medium heat. Add the diced onions and cook, stirring frequently, until translucent, about 6 to 8 minutes.
    
- Stir in rice and garlic and continue cooking, stirring continuously, for about 1 minute.
    
- Add in the chicken stock, half and half and salt and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a boil and then reduce the heat to medium low. Cook, stirring frequently, until the rice is tender, about 22 to 25 minutes. Remove from heat.
    
- Carefully stir in the cooked broccoli, grated cheddar cheese and Parmesan cheese making sure to evenly distribute the ingredients.
    
- Transfer to the prepared baking dish (or, if using an oven safe skillet, consider baking it right in the skillet) and prepare the topping.
    
- In a small bowl, stir to combine the melted butter, Panko breadcrumbs, smoked paprika and Parmesan cheese. Sprinkle the topping over the casserole.
    
- Bake the casserole for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown and bubbling. Remove and let rest for 5 minutes before serving.

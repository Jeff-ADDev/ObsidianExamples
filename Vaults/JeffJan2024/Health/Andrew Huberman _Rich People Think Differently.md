## Introduction


- Early stages of hard work and focus may feel like agitation, stress, and confusion due to the norepinephrine adrenaline system kicking in.
- The brain needs to warm up and start honing in on which circuits will be active.
- It is unreasonable to expect immediate high productivity in a concentrated state.



## The Role of Dopamine


- Dopamine is released anytime a milestone is achieved or when one feels they are on the right path.
- Dopamine takes norepinephrine and pushes it back down, allowing for more space and duration in highly focused work.
- Dopamine helps wire in behaviors and creates a memory of being on the right path.



## Success and Focus


- Success in any endeavor is closely related to the level of focus one can bring.
- The reward system is internal and is not dependent on external factors.
- Growth mindset involves recognizing agitation, stress, and confusion as an entry point to achieving focus.



## Rewarding the Effort Process


- The ability to self-reward the effort process is extremely powerful.
- Rewarding oneself when achieving milestones suppresses adrenaline and provides more energy and time to continue the task.
- The dopamine released in response to rewards can restore levels of noradrenaline.



## Harnessing Neurochemicals for Performance


- Pushing through pain points can be achieved by reframing mentally and recognizing progress.
- The lift one feels is not just psychological, but a neurochemical effect of dopamine suppressing norepinephrine.
- External rewards cannot sustain long-term success and growth.



## Controlling Duration, Path, and Outcome


- One of the most powerful things a person can do is to learn to control duration, path, and outcome.
- Attaching an internal sense of reward to the process can provide more energy and focus.
- Self-rewarding and setting goals within the larger goal can lead to infinite energy and focus to pursue those goals.

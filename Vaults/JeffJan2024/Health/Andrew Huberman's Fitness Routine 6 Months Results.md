## Introduction


- [[Andrew D. Huberman | Andrew Huberman]] is a professor of neurobiology and [[Ophthalmology]] at [[Stanford University School of Medicine | Stanford School of Medicine]].
- He started his own podcast, the Huberman Lab podcast, to discuss topics related to neuroscience, biology, and health.
- One of his popular episodes discusses the foundational fitness protocol, which aims to maximize all aspects of fitness.



## Sunday: Long endurance training


- The protocol starts on a Sunday with long endurance training.
- Cardio exercises such as rowing, cycling, slow jogging, swimming, and hiking are recommended.
- The goal is to reach 60 to 75 minutes of cardio in zone two, where you can speak normally and nasal breathe.



## Monday: Resistance training


- Monday is dedicated to leg resistance training.
- A 10-minute warm-up is followed by 50 to 60 minutes of resistance training.
- Compound movements and a mixture of strength and hypertrophy training are recommended.



## Tuesday: Heat and cold exposure


- Deliberate heat exposure in a sauna is recommended for cardiovascular benefits and general health benefits.
- Deliberate cold exposure helps enhance focus, increase energy, and convert white fat cells to brown fat cells.
- The protocol includes four sessions of 30 minutes in a sauna and two to four sessions of cold exposure lasting one to five minutes each.



## Wednesday: Torso and neck resistance training


- Wednesday focuses on resistance training for the torso and neck.
- Push and pull movements are performed to train the chest, shoulders, and back.
- Neck training is included to improve posture, reduce the risk of injury, and enhance performance in sports involving head collisions.



## Thursday: Cardiovascular training


- Thursday is dedicated to moderate to high intensity cardiovascular training.
- The goal is to hit 75 to 80 percent of maximal effort and max heart rate for around 35 minutes.
- Various cardio exercises such as running, cycling, rowing, and jumping jacks can be used.



## Friday: High intensity interval training (HIIT)


- Friday's protocol involves high intensity interval training (HIIT).
- It includes 20 to 30 seconds of all-out sprints followed by 10 seconds of rest for eight to ten rounds.
- Options for HIIT exercises include sprinting, rowing, assault bike, skiing machine, and sand sprints.



## Saturday: Arm, neck, and calf resistance training


- Saturday is the final day of the week and focuses on resistance training for arms, neck, and calves.
- This day can be customized to target specific muscles that need more attention.
- Examples of exercises are provided for each muscle group.



## Results


- The individual who followed the foundational fitness protocol provided their personal results.
- Improvements were seen in strength and hypertrophy exercises.
- Heat and cold exposure led to mental improvements and tolerance to extreme temperatures.
- High intensity interval training and cardiovascular training showed improvements in running speed and endurance.



## Final overview and review


- The foundational fitness protocol is described as the foundation for building a personalized fitness routine.
- Implementing all five training modalities (endurance, resistance, heat, cold, and HIIT) can lead to overall health improvements.
- It is important to find a personal reason why to stay motivated to follow the protocol.
- Starting with what is manageable and gradually increasing intensity is key.

## Strength Training
Strength Training - Relates to mechanics, the force capability of muscle, and firing the right muscle group in the right sequence.  Intensity is the primary driver in training for strength, as well as speed and power.  You want to use mostly compound movements for Strength Training.

## Hypertrophy
Hypertrophy Training - Optimises for muscle size, without consideration of function or strength.  Just relates to getting the muscle bigger.  Volume is primary driver, Taget 10 Working sets per muscles groups, per week.  Or 25 if highly trained.

| Type      | Strength  | Hypertrophy   |
| --------- | --------- | ------------- |
| Weight    | > 70% 1 Rep Max | 60% - 80% 1 Rep Max |
| Reps      | 3 - 5     | 8 - 15 / Can go to 30       |
| Sets      | 3 - 5     | 10 Sets Per week per muscle group  |
| Rest      | 3 - 5     | Less Rest and under 2 Minutes     |
| Exercises | 3 - 5     | 5 + in session          |
